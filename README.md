# Healthcare_Analysis
This project focused on predicting healthcare costs using real-world data and advanced analytics.

I began by cleaning and merging datasets containing patient demographics, medical history, and hospitalization details.

I performed exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and visualized key patterns across hospital tiers, city levels, and patient health factors. Using Python, I built regression models including Ridge and Gradient Boosting, applying cross-validation, pipelines, and regularization. 

The final model accurately predicted costs based on features like age, BMI, smoking status, and hospital tier. SQL was used to extract key insights such as cost variations among diabetic patients and hospital tiers. 

Lastly, I developed an interactive Tableau dashboard to present the findings visually. This project enhanced my data science, machine learning, SQL, and data storytelling skills, and prepared me for solving real-world healthcare analytics problems.
